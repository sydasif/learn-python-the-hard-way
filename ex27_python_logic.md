# Python Operator

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Types of Operator in Python

1. Comparison Operator
2. Logical Operator
3. Arithmetic Operator
4. Assignment Operator
5. Membership Operator
6. Identity Operator

## Comparison Operator

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator | Name |
|----------| --------|
| == |  equal |
| != | not equal |
| < | Less than |
| > | Greater than |
| <= | less than or equal |
| >= | greater than or equal |

## Logical Operator

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

- and
- or
- not

### Truth Table of Logical Operator

#### and truth table

| and | output |
|-----|--------|
| True and True | True |
| True and False | False |
| False and True | False |
| False and False | False |

### or truth table

| or | output |
|-----|--------|
| True or True | True |
| True or False | True |
| False or True | True |
| False or False | False |

### not truth table

|  not | output |
|-----|--------|
| not True | False |
| not False | True |

## Arithmetic Operator

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

| Operator | Name|
| --------| ------|
| + | Plus |
| - | Minus |
| * | Multiply |
| / | Division |
| // | Floor Division |
| % | Modulus |
|** | Exponentiation |

## Assignment Operator

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

| Operator |
| --------|
| += |
| -= |
| *= |
| /= |
| %= |
| **= |
| //= |

## Membership Operator

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

| Operator |
| --------|
| in |
| not in |

## Identity Operator

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

| Operator |
|----------|
| is |
| is not |
